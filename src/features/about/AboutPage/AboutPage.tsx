          . I'm a front-end leaning full-stack developer with more than 10 years
          of professional web development experience. I enjoy coding as a day
          job and as a hobby (check out my{' '}
          <Link href="/projects">open-source projects</Link>).

          As you can probably tell I like minimal design. I also strongly
          believe speed plays a huge part in the usablity and user experience of
          a product, and I put in a fair bit of effort to make this site fast
          &amp; responsive.

          When not coding I enjoy being outdoors and love hiking and cycling.
          Sometimes I do a bit of indoor bouldering too. I grew up in South
          Africa before moving to London, then Barcelona. I recently moved back
          to the UK and am currently residing in beautiful rural North
          Yorkshire.

          I don't consider myself a very good photographer but I do really enjoy
          nature and being outdoors. Most of the photos below were taken on a
          mobile device.
