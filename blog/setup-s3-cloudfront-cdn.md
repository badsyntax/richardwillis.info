This posts outlines how to:

- Set up [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) & [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) in AWS
- Set up a [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/) function to fix the cache headers
- Set up an Alternate domain with TLS

## Motivation

- Files are cached at the Edge and are quicker to download for all users across all locations
- Compression is handled automatically by the CDN
- File serving is offloaded from the runtime application server allowing it to focus solely on request/runtime computations

## Setting up CloudFront & S3

Setting up a basic Cloudfront distribution and S3 bucket is fairly straightforward, but the complexity lies in setting the correct response headers.

### Response Headers

- CORS headers are required as you'll be serving your assets on a different domain
- Cache headers are required to control both the CloudFront & Browser caching behaviour

Initially my response headers were being too aggressively cached by CloudFront, and the browser could not perform cross domain `fetch` requests. This was fixed by specifying a custom [CachePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-cachepolicy.html) to forward the request `Origin` and `Access-Control` headers to S3, which instructs S3 to return the CORS response headers, as well as prevent CloudFormation caching the headers when the `Origin` and `Access-Control` request headers change.

The second caching issue I had was browser cache. The issue is fairly complex but boils down to S3 not sending a `Vary: Origin` header which results in the browser caching the CORS headers and not allowing cross domain `fetch`/`xhr` requests. (If you're using `cURL` to test this, you won't see the issue as it's only obvious in the browser due to how it caches responses.)

Here are some resources covering the issue in more detail.

- [Issue with CloudFront not returning correct Vary header](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31732533/s3-cors-always-send-vary-origin)
- [Not able to set Vary response header in S3](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21371500/492325)
- [Overview of the caching issue in Chrome](https://serverfault.com/questions/856904/chrome-s3-cloudfront-no-access-control-allow-origin-header-on-initial-xhr-req/856948#856948)

The solution was to use a Lambda function to "fix" the S3 response headers (to add `Vary: Origin` for all responses from S3).

### Creating the Stack

After a _lot_ of trial and error I managed to create a working CloudFormation template which creates the following resources:

- An S3 bucket with [CORS configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-cors.html) for a list of allowed origins
- A CloudFront [OriginAccessIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-cloudfrontoriginaccessidentity.html) that allows CloudFront to read from S3
- A CloudFront [CachePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-cachepolicy.html), with [CORS headers forwarded to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cloudfront-cachepolicy-cachepolicyconfig.html) for a particular url path (eg `/_next/*`).
- A CloudFront [Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-distribution.html) that uses the S3 bucket as origin source
- A Lambda function used for modifying the response headers from a S3 `origin-response` event
- Custom root domain with TLS

#### Step 1 - Create the Root Domain Certificate

This is a manual step as it requires domain verification.

- Note that AWS certificates are _free_
- You **must** create the certificate in region `us-east-1`

Head on over to [AWS Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1) to create a certificate for your domain.

Once the certificate is created and domain verified, take note of the certificate ARN and move onto the next step.

#### Step 2 - Create the Stack with CloudFormation

Note the following before continuing:

- When you update the stack you'll need to bump the version to allow proper deployment of the lambda function
- You must create the stack in the **`us-east-1`** region for the following reasons:
  - `us-east-1` is where the CloudFront control pane sits and requires resources (eg certificates & buckets) to be created in the same region
  - There would be additional S3 data transfer charges if the `Lambda@Edge` executions are happening in a different AWS Region from where your source S3 bucket is located

## Setting S3 Object Cache Headers

CDN assets should be immutable and have long-cache headers (at least a year). Cache headers are set at an object level in S3, meaning you need to set headers when uploading assets to S3.

Typically you'd use the `aws s3 sync` command to upload assets, and this command accepts a `cache-control` header value. Here's an example of how it can work in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jakejarvis/s3-sync-action):

```yaml
- name: Sync static assets to S3
  uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master
  with:
    args: --cache-control public,max-age=31536000,immutable
  env:
    AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-2'
    SOURCE_DIR: '.next/static'
    DEST_DIR: '_next/static'
```

## Debugging Lambda Errors

If you make changes to the lambda function and get `502` ("LambdaValidationError from cloudfront") or `503` ("LambdaExecutionError from cloudfront") errors when attempting to request your assets, you can use [CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) to view the errors but _you need to be in the correct region (closest to you) to find the correct logs_.

## Conclusion

I spent a long time getting this to work, much longer than I initially thought it'd take. I assumed it would be easy to connect Cloudfront to S3 and everything would "just work" (famous last words indeed), as these services are built to work well together, but I was wrong, and the devil is always in the detail. Saying that, having constructed a working CloudFormation template means I won't have to go through this pain again in the future.

The pricing is somewhat complicated to figure out, but based on what others have mentioned, I don't expect to pay more than a few cents a month for a personal website.
